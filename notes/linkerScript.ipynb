    "# What is a linker script?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a text file that explains how different sections of the object files should be merged to create an output file\n",
    "- Linker and locator \n",
    "- Linker script also includes code and data memory address and size information\n",
    "- These scripts are written using _GNU linker command language_\n",
    "- GNU linker script has the file extension of `.ld`\n",
    "- You must supply linker script at the linking phase to the linker using `-T` option\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic linker script commands\n",
    " * Entry\n",
    " * Memory\n",
    " * Sections\n",
    " * Keep\n",
    " * Align\n",
    " * AT>\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Entry\n",
    " * This command is used to set the Entry point address information in th header of the final elf generated file\n",
    " * For a microcontroller, the `Reset_Handler` is the entry point into the application. This is the first piece of code that executes after a processor reset\n",
    " * The debugger uses this information to locate the first function to execute\n",
    " * This is not a mandatory command to use, but required when you debug the elf file using the debugger (GDB)\n",
    " * Syntax: Entry(_symbol_name_); Example: `Entry(Reset_Handler)`\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Memory \n",
    "\n",
    " - Allows you to describe the different memories present in the target processor and their start address and size information\n",
    " - The linker uses information mentioned in this command to assign addresses to merged sections\n",
    " - Helps in data size verifications as this helps to calculate the total code and data memory so far consumed\n",
    " - Fine tune various memories available in the target and allow different sections to occupy different memory areas\n",
    " - Typiclaly one linker scipt has one memory command\n",

    "In the above code snippet we have taken the STM32F446RE microcontroller's memories and wrote them as three sections, namely, \n",
    "1. FLASH - with read (r) and executable (x) access only. We dont write to it, so we did not grant access\n",
    "2. SRAM1 - with (rwx), meaning read, write and executable access\n",

    "So, we basically added `116 + 16 = 132 - 4 = 128`. So, why did we subtract 4KB? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did we subtract 4KB?\n",
    "This is an important learning moment. Some microcontrollers have memory layout conventions that reserve some code memories or have other special functions. If we do not wish to use these memories, we exclude them from linker script. So, for the STM32 architecure, the manual says...\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](images/embeddedSRAM_Note.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is why we subtracted 4KB as we are not writing to it, or interacting with it\n",
    "- It’s not a linker script syntax requirement, but a platform-specific memory layout convention\n",
    "- So, you need to read the microcontroller data sheet to assess whether you have such special features in the SRAM spaces \n",
    "- If you wish to intearct with this \"back SRAM\", you need to write it separately in the linker script"

    "\n",
    "> Note that there are many files that have the `.text` section when they pass the compilation phase and manifest as `.o` files. So, the `.text` in linker takes all these individual sections and distills them into one contiiguous memory section. Same logic follows for all other sections.\n",
