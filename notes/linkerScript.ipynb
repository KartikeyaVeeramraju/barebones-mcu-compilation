    "# What is a linker script?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is a text file that explains how different sections of the object files should be merged to create an output file\n",
    "- Linker and locator \n",
    "- Linker script also includes code and data memory address and size information\n",
    "- These scripts are written using _GNU linker command language_\n",
    "- GNU linker script has the file extension of `.ld`\n",
    "- You must supply linker script at the linking phase to the linker using `-T` option\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic linker script commands\n",
    " * Entry\n",
    " * Memory\n",
    " * Sections\n",
    " * Keep\n",
    " * Align\n",
    " * AT>\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Entry\n",
    " * This command is used to set the Entry point address information in th header of the final elf generated file\n",
    " * For a microcontroller, the `Reset_Handler` is the entry point into the application. This is the first piece of code that executes after a processor reset\n",
    " * The debugger uses this information to locate the first function to execute\n",
    " * This is not a mandatory command to use, but required when you debug the elf file using the debugger (GDB)\n",
    " * Syntax: Entry(_symbol_name_); Example: `Entry(Reset_Handler)`\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Memory \n",
    "\n",
    " - Allows you to describe the different memories present in the target processor and their start address and size information\n",
    " - The linker uses information mentioned in this command to assign addresses to merged sections\n",
    " - Helps in data size verifications as this helps to calculate the total code and data memory so far consumed\n",
    " - Fine tune various memories available in the target and allow different sections to occupy different memory areas\n",
    " - Typiclaly one linker scipt has one memory command\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",

    "    name(attr) : ORIGIN = origin, LENGTH = len\n",
    "}\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why did we subtract 4KB?\n",
    "This is an important learning moment. Some microcontrollers have memory layout conventions that reserve some code memories or have other special functions. If we do not wish to use these memories, we exclude them from linker script. So, for the STM32 architecure, the manual says...\n",

    "![image](images/embeddedSRAM_Note.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is why we subtracted 4KB as we are not writing to it, or interacting with it\n",
    "- It’s not a linker script syntax requirement, but a platform-specific memory layout convention\n",
    "- So, you need to read the microcontroller data sheet to assess whether you have such special features in the SRAM spaces \n",
    "- If you wish to intearct with this \"back SRAM\", you need to write it separately in the linker script"

    "  - STM32 microcontrollers support **Execute-In-Place (XIP)**, meaning code runs directly from FLASH without copying to RAM.\n",
    "  - The **vector table** (`.isr_section`) must be at the beginning of FLASH so that the CPU can correctly fetch interrupt and reset vectors at startup.\n",

    "  - However, their **initial values** need to be stored somewhere non-volatile; thus, they are initially placed in **FLASH**.\n",
    "  - During startup, **boot code copies** the contents of the `.data` section from its LMA in FLASH to its VMA in SRAM.\n",

    "Conside the main.c file and we have a variable declaration. We want to store value of 100 in the global variable. This anyways gets stored in data section. In the background, this will get converted to an address manipulation. So, how is this variable name replaced by address? That is what the symbol table does. When we compile the main.o, we compile the symbol table. For the compiler and liunler terminology, we call these symbol names. The symbol tabl;e has address and symbol name. So my value has a symbol name and an addres. So, the address is resolved by the symbol table. Again the fun1 definition belongs to the .text section. But this is again stored as a symbol in the symbol table. \n",
    "\n",
    "In C programs, we dont do symbol declarations. That's the compiler's job. But for the first time, we are actually going to manipulate and use the symbols in the linker script. These symbols pertain to the boundary informations. These are called linker script symbols. \n",

    "- A symbol is the name given for an address\n",
    "- `__max_heap_size = 0x400;` When linker sees this entry, its going to add the entry to the symbol table. \n",
    "- we can also declare symbols inside the SECTIONS like catching the end of text section by writing `end_of_text = .;`. This is the location counter, which (remember) increments automatically. So, when you say `.`, the symbol will hold the end of the text section or whatever. \n",
