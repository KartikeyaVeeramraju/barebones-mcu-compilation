    "## What is a vector table??\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**:  \n",
    "  A vector table is a data structure used by a microcontroller to manage interrupt and exception handling. It contains addresses (pointers) to the corresponding handler functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**:  \n",
    "  It directs the processor to the correct Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) or exception handler when an interrupt or exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Location**:  \n",
    "  Typically located at a fixed address in memory (e.g., `0x00000000` for ARM Cortex-M devices by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structure**:\n",
    "  - The first entry often contains the **initial stack pointer**.\n",
    "  - Subsequent entries contain addresses of **ISR or exception handlers**.\n",
    "  - Each entry corresponds to a specific interrupt or exception vector (e.g., Reset, NMI, HardFault).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage**:\n",
    "  - On an interrupt, the processor uses the interrupt number to index into the vector table.\n",
    "  - It fetches the address from the table and jumps to that handler function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customization**:\n",
    "  - Developers can modify the vector table to point to their own custom ISR implementations.\n",
    "  - Some systems allow relocating the vector table to a different memory region (e.g., using the `VTOR` register in ARM Cortex-M).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example (Simplified)**:\n",
    "  ```c\n",
    "  const void* vector_table[] __attribute__((section(\".vectors\"))) = {\n",
    "      (void*) &stack_top,       // Initial Stack Pointer\n",
    "      Reset_Handler,            // Reset Handler\n",
    "      NMI_Handler,              // NMI Handler\n",
    "      HardFault_Handler,        // HardFault Handler\n",
    "      // ... other handlers\n",
